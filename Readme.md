# dumdom - The dumb DOM component library

**dumdom** is a component library that renders (and re-renders) immutable data
efficiently. It delivers on the basic value proposition of React and its peers
while eschewing features like component local state and object oriented APIs,
and embracing ClojureScript features like immutable data structures.

**dumdom** aims to be API compatible with
[Quiescent](https://github.com/levand/quiescent/), and can be used as a drop-in
replacement for it so long as you don't use React features directly.

**dumdom** is currently a wrapper for
[Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom), but that should be considered
an implementation detail, and may be subject to change.

## Documentation

**dumdom** is currently under development. Documentation will follow when the
library is functional and usable.
